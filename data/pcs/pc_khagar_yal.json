    "long_description": "Khagar Yal is a massive, broad-shouldered Orc with ruggedly noble features—tusks proud rather than grotesque, posture straight like a bannerpole, and golden-yellow eyes that burn with that 'wolfish' lycanthrope sheen when the hunt is on. His gear is practical-but-mythic: fur-lined mail, weather-stained leathers, and the red-blue Stormcloak palette worked into straps and cloth. He carries himself like a clan-leader who's done the math on violence and still chose it—measured until the moment he isn't."

He can use Empathy in place of Rapport, and Once Per Scene may Create Advantage gaining a +2 bonus to the roll when discerning someone's heart. Learning one of the following deep seated truths of their character, Their Intent, Their Pain (a personal loss), Their Struggle. On SWS he learns two.",
    "Supernatural Regeneration: Because of Khagar Yal's Lycanthropy, his body regenerates wounds far faster than most. Allowing him to use Physique for his Defense rolls, and Once per session he may reduce up to a set number of stress equal to his Physique, or choose to reduce a Physical Consequence down by one or to none. Severe to Moderate to Mild to None."
