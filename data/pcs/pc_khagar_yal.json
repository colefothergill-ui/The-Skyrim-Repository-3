  "backstory": "**Civil War Entry**: Khagar Yal: \u201cOrcs of the Stronghold\u2019s of Skyrim see me, and know the tale. The heretic Warchief of Hircine. He who lost his Clan to Thalmor, to the Sorceress Elenwen. The Thalmor Witch wished to occupy our Grotto. Seeking to utilize The Lord of the Hunt\u2019s blessing as their; Elven Hamlet of Operation. To spy upon the enemies of their Dominion. To them it was a fortuitous enchanted sanctuary from the cold of Eastmarch. For us it was our home, blessed by The Lord of the Hunt, who intended it be for us! I said no, so they use their Zugra (Cursed) Magicka on us, forced my companions to change, and turn on one another. If not for Lord Hircine\u2019s spear gifted to me, I too would\u2019ve changed, and fallen as well.Only I had not, Instead I withdrew from Crun Voshu Grotto, and returned the following night, but not as an Orc as Predator hunting Prey. Those Thalmor lasted not five full minutes, before the Witch Elenwen retreated through a portal to her embassy. Since the, I have sworn an oath of the hunt, and vowed to have her head for the Clansmen she claimed just a day prior! Wracked up so many Altmer bodies in the following six months that it drew the local Nord's attention, and praise. They named me, Stag of Eastmarch. Beginning to sequester my advice, and aide anytime a Thalmor gave them issues, or took one of there own. Was not long after, that I had met the Bear of Markarth, Chieftan Ulfric Stormcloak himself. His code was non to disimilar to my own, garnering a fast bond when he came to encounter me in the geyser's west of Kynesgrove. I told him of the Predator upon his porch, and as it would have it, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So when he asked me to join his ranks, I all to happily accepted.\n\n**Civil War Stance**: Khagar Yal: \"Support is a strong word, but between my bond with the Chieftan of Ysgrammor's city, my Hunter's oath on Elenwen and her Thalmor. Well, let's just say following Hircine's Code is far easier amongst their ranks. Besides, The Spear of Bitter Mercy requires worthy prey, and frankly, I've never trusted the Empire! Skyrim is better without it's meddling, and all the more without the Witch Elenwen having a say about a damn thing. Finally, Ulfric has promised to lend aide toward the rebuilding of Crun Voshu Kala's lodging inside the grotto that, the Thalmor had burned on their way out. From their, I will rebuild my Clan.\n\n**Motivation**: Khagar Yal: \"Hm, to answer this. One must explain my Clan's creed that I still carry. My Clansmen were not like other displaced Strongholds of Skyrim! We did not follow Malacath, but Lord Hircine. For each and every one of us carried his Blessing; The Blood of the Bear. So we adopted a new code, one based of the beliefs of Hircine. One: Hunt only worthy prey, not those whom cannot defend themselves. Two: Honor your pack, your prey, and all of which it provides for. Three: One should practice cunning and wisdom as you do to hone strength and skill. To not is to be no better than the prey you hunt. Four: Slay prey only which would slay you if they could. (Don\u2019t kill pacifist who won\u2019t fight back.) Five: Maintain the natural order in the ecosystem where symbiosis is achieved. In Nord terms, the Code is a perpetuating moral code, as it is a driver to improve one's strength as a Noble warrior, and Beast Blood. However, if you want the more finiteless Warchief response. I want my Clan back, I want Elenwen hunted and mounted, and I want to one day be a Legend amongst my people. Hah! Oh yeah, and I'd like to be the Lord of the Hunt's Champion. Bloodmoon, I already carry his spear. Not long left to go on that.\n\n**Connections**: Khagar Yal: \"They are all dead. Most Nord's look upon me with as much respect, as they do apprehension. Prejudice will do that to you. Not like I care, just makes you a less sharp sword when you're hung up on the pelt of the prey, and not the wit of the pack. Despite this, Ulfric and I seem to be on good terms, we've even endeavored to go on a few Hunts together. Galmar is as much an Orc as I am. Hah! I'd never tell him that though. Regardless, he too has my respect. A feeling that is mutual. Lastly, I do enjoy the Nord named Ralof, strong, more cunning than he let's on. Staunch, like stone. Whiterun? No, However, I had heard tale of 'The Companions'. They interest me, I'd very much like to cross blades with their best. I hope they defend Whiterun when we take it, should Chieftan Balgruuf end up not seeing it Ulfric's way.\"",
