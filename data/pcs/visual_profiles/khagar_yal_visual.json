  "appearance": {
    "short": "Khagar Yal is a towering Orsimer war-chief—tusks, scar-hardened features, and predator-calm eyes beneath a snowy sabre cat pelt headdress. Fur-trimmed Nordic plate and Stormcloak-blue cloth mark him as both warrior and omen. In his grip rests a rune-lit spear that glows cold-blue, antlered at the head like a Huntsman's trophy turned into steel.",
    "detailed": "Built like a siege engine and moving with the patience of a predator, Khagar wears a snowy sabre cat pelt as both cloak and crown—the cat's head set over his brow like a trophy-helm. His Orsimer visage is brutal-noble: tusks prominent, expression stern, and a gaze that feels like it's weighing the room for weakness. Heavy Nordic plate is layered with fur at the shoulders and hem, Stormcloak-blue cloth hanging from his waist like a banner claimed in blood. His spear is long and balanced, runes faintly aglow along the haft; the head burns with cold-blue/teal light, framed by antler-like prongs, with small charm-trinkets swaying from the grip—subtle, present, and unsettling in how quietly sacred it feels.",
    "combat": "In motion, Khagar fights like a closing trap—spearpoint herding space, boots biting snow and stone, armor fur rippling with each breath. His eyes burn wolf-gold under the aurora, and every feint looks like the beginning of an execution. When he smiles, it's never joy—only certainty.",
    "hircine": "Near moonlight, the air around Khagar feels tighter, like the world is holding its breath. The spear's glow deepens to a cold-blue hum, and his gaze shifts—less man, more hunt. You get the sense the difference between 'ally' and 'prey' is a line he can redraw whenever the Huntsman whispers."
