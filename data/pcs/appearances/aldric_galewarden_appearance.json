  "detailed_description": "Aldric reads like a contradiction: the bone-structure and posture of a man raised around status, and the practiced, quiet economy of motion of someone who survives in alleys. He's tall for a Nord, athletic rather than bulky—built for speed, vaults, and sudden violence. His cloak is a deep black-violet, a color that drinks moonlight until it catches the wind and flashes like inked silk; it's cut to avoid snagging while climbing or sprinting. Under it sits light leather gear—flexible, travel-worn, and tailored for mobility. His eyes are a striking icy blue, hard to forget once seen; in low light they give the unsettling impression that he's already clocked three exits and your weakest habit. Even when hooded, he carries a quiet handsomeness: clean lines, a confident smirk that shows up right before he does something reckless. He looks like a noble who learned to steal, not a thief who learned manners.",
