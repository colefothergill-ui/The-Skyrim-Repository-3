# Session 02 — Battle-Born Bargain (WHT-08)
**Scene:** WHT-08  
**Location:** Whiterun — Battle-Born manor (private chamber)

## The Art of the Deal
- Aldric refused to be treated like a Companion-for-hire, reframing the ask as a **Thieves Guild exception** with hard terms.
- Aldric leveraged **Art of the Deal** (+2 Rapport) and invoked **Olfrid's OUI** to lock a battlefield contract.
- **Terms (provisional):**
  - **Payment:** 1,500 septims after the Battle of Whiterun, contingent on Hadvar surviving and Aldric being publicly seen fighting alongside him.
  - **Access:** Battle-Born influence will quietly open "doors" for the Outfit in Whiterun where Olfrid can pull strings.
  - **Addendum (binding):** Olfrid will use his connections to find Aldric a **legitimate Thu'um instructor lead + introduction**.

## Output State
- Scene Aspect created: **Good Business** (invokes traded for addendum)
- Objective set: Prepare for the Battle of Whiterun; make contact with Hadvar using Olfrid's sealed note; pursue the Voice instructor lead.
