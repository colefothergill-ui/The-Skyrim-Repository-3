# Session 02 — Battle-Born Bargain (WHT-08)
**Scene:** WHT-08  
**Location:** Whiterun — Battle-Born manor (private chamber)

## The Art of the Deal
- Aldric refused to be treated like a Companion-for-hire, reframing the ask as a **Thieves Guild exception** with hard terms.
- Aldric leveraged **Art of the Deal** (+2 Rapport) and invoked **Olfrid's OUI** to lock a battlefield contract.
- **Terms (provisional):**
  - **Payment:** 1,500 septims after the Battle of Whiterun, contingent on Hadvar surviving and Aldric being publicly seen fighting alongside him.
  - **Access:** Battle-Born influence will quietly open "doors" for the Outfit in Whiterun where Olfrid can pull strings.
  - **Addendum (binding):** Olfrid will use his connections to find Aldric a **legitimate Thu'um instructor lead + introduction**.

## Output State
- Scene Aspect created: **Good Business** (invokes traded for addendum)
- Objective set: Prepare for the Battle of Whiterun; make contact with Hadvar using Olfrid's sealed note; pursue the Voice instructor lead.

## Scene WHT-09 — Muster at the Gate / West Wall Assignment

**Location:** Whiterun — West Wall (gatehouse section)  
**Scene Aspects:**
- Crowded Battlements
- Biting Wind Off the Tundra

### Meeting Legate Rikke and Hadvar

Aldric made his way to the west wall muster where Imperial forces were assembling for the defense of Whiterun. The gatehouse section was crowded with soldiers preparing for battle, and a biting wind swept across the tundra, cutting through the gathering forces.

At the gate muster, Aldric encountered **Legate Rikke**, the commanding officer of the Imperial Legion forces in Skyrim, alongside **Hadvar**, who was organizing his section. Aldric presented Olfrid Battle-Born's sealed note to Hadvar, who broke the seal and read the contents.

### Create Advantage Success: "Assigned to Hadvar's Section"

The note from Olfrid carried enough weight to secure Aldric's official assignment to Hadvar's section. Hadvar confirmed the arrangement, granting Aldric legitimate standing within the Imperial forces.

**Advantage Created:** "Assigned to Hadvar's Section" (1 free invoke)

### Equipment Requisition

With his assignment confirmed, Aldric was able to requisition equipment from the Imperial quartermaster:
- **Signal-Smoke Pot x2**: Can be used to create advantage (SMOKE SCREEN with 1 free invoke). Consumable.
- **Throwing Axes x2**: Can be used for ranged attacks (1 zone) using Fight at -1. Recoverable after exchange if possible.

### Thu'um Instructor Progress

By making contact with Hadvar and establishing himself within the Imperial military structure, Aldric advanced his search for a Thu'um instructor. The Imperial channel that Olfrid promised is now active, with Hadvar serving as the key contact.

**Clock Progress:** Thu'um Instructor (through Olfrid) ticked from 1/4 to 2/4.
