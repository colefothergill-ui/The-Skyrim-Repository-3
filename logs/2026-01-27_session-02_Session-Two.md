# Session 02 — Battle-Born Bargain (WHT-08)
**Scene:** WHT-08  
**Location:** Whiterun — Battle-Born manor (private chamber)

## The Art of the Deal
- Aldric refused to be treated like a Companion-for-hire, reframing the ask as a **Thieves Guild exception** with hard terms.
- Aldric leveraged **Art of the Deal** (+2 Rapport) and invoked **Olfrid's OUI** to lock a battlefield contract.
- **Terms (provisional):**
  - **Payment:** 1,500 septims after the Battle of Whiterun, contingent on Hadvar surviving and Aldric being publicly seen fighting alongside him.
  - **Access:** Battle-Born influence will quietly open "doors" for the Outfit in Whiterun where Olfrid can pull strings.
  - **Addendum (binding):** Olfrid will use his connections to find Aldric a **legitimate Thu'um instructor lead + introduction**.

## Output State
- Scene Aspect created: **Good Business** (invokes traded for addendum)
- Objective set: Prepare for the Battle of Whiterun; make contact with Hadvar using Olfrid's sealed note; pursue the Voice instructor lead.

## Scene WHT-09 — West Wall Muster (Hadvar's Unit)

**Location:** Whiterun — West Wall (gatehouse section)  
**Scene Aspects:**
- Crowded Battlements
- Biting Wind Off the Tundra

### Meeting Legate Rikke and Hadvar

Aldric made his way to the west wall muster where Imperial forces were assembling for the defense of Whiterun. The gatehouse section was crowded with soldiers preparing for battle, and a biting wind swept across the tundra, cutting through the gathering forces.

At the gate muster, Aldric encountered **Legate Rikke**, the commanding officer of the Imperial Legion forces in Skyrim, alongside **Hadvar**, who was organizing his section. Aldric presented Olfrid Battle-Born's sealed note to Hadvar, who broke the seal and read the contents.

### Compel Accepted: "Hadvar's Guard Up"

While Hadvar acknowledged the note from Olfrid Battle-Born, he remained cautious and professional, keeping his guard up around this Thieves Guild operative. Hadvar made it clear that Aldric would need to prove himself in the upcoming battle—this wasn't just going to be a favor handed out on Battle-Born's say-so.

**Compel:** "Hadvar's Guard Up" - Aldric accepted this compel, earning a Fate Point. Hadvar is watching closely and expects Aldric to demonstrate his worth and loyalty during the battle.

**Scene Aspect Created (GM):** "Hadvar's Guard Up (GM: 1 free invoke)"

### Using Art of the Deal: Locking the Unit Claim

Aldric wasn't content to simply be another soldier in the ranks. Drawing on his expertise from **The Art of the Deal**, he negotiated with Hadvar to establish his standing within the unit and set clear terms for their collaboration.

**Scene Aspect Created (PC):** "Under Hadvar's Banner (PC: 1 free invoke)" - Aldric successfully used his social prowess to position himself as a recognized member of Hadvar's unit, giving him leverage and legitimacy during the upcoming battle.

### Wager Terms with Hadvar

As part of the negotiation, Aldric and Hadvar established wager terms that would govern their arrangement during the Battle of Whiterun:

- **Prove Your Worth:** Aldric must demonstrate loyalty and competence fighting alongside Hadvar's unit during the battle
- **Visibility Matters:** The arrangement with Olfrid requires that Aldric be publicly seen fighting under Hadvar's banner
- **Imperial Channel:** Success in the battle will strengthen the Imperial connection for Aldric's Thu'um instructor search through Olfrid's network
- **Mutual Benefit:** Both parties gain from this arrangement—Hadvar gets a skilled fighter, and Aldric gains legitimate military standing and Battle-Born patronage

### Equipment Requisition

With his assignment confirmed, Aldric was able to requisition equipment from the Imperial quartermaster:
- **Signal-Smoke Pot x2**: Can be used to create advantage (SMOKE SCREEN with 1 free invoke). Consumable.
- **Throwing Axes x2**: Can be used for ranged attacks (1 zone) using Fight at -1. Recoverable after exchange if possible.

### Thu'um Instructor Progress

By making contact with Hadvar and establishing himself within the Imperial military structure, Aldric advanced his search for a Thu'um instructor. The Imperial channel that Olfrid promised is now active, with Hadvar serving as the key contact.

**Clock Progress:** Thu'um Instructor (through Olfrid) ticked from 1/4 to 2/4.

### Scene Setup: Incoming Assault

The scene concluded with the Imperial forces preparing for the imminent Stormcloak assault. Scouts reported enemy forces approaching with siege ladders and preparations to breach the gate. The battle was about to begin, and Aldric found himself positioned on the battlements alongside Hadvar's unit, ready to face the incoming attack.
