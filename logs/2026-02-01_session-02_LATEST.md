## Session Continuation Addendum (Canon) — Breachrun to Dragonsreach

### Major Events (Canon)
1. **Ralof's call**: Hadvar was Taken Out alive; Khagar ceded the final decision to Ralof; Ralof chose **custody** over execution.
2. **Galmar checked**: Galmar pressed for a "clean kill," but Ralof held the line with Khagar's backing; internal hardliner resentment begins.
3. **Hadvar secured**: Hadvar bound and moved behind Stormcloak lines under Ralof's assigned watchers.
4. **City push begins**: Khagar pressed into Whiterun's districts toward Dragonsreach.
5. **Aela encountered**: Aela the Huntress engaged as rooftop archer; Khagar's hunt compelled.
6. **Aela concedes / Hunt-debt**: Aela conceded before being Taken Out; Aela's Hunting Bow recovered; Khagar released her under oath to withdraw to Jorrvaskr and stay out of the skirmish. Aela owes a Hunt-debt.
7. **Civilians redirected**: Evacuation corridor established toward the Temple of Kynareth, reducing collateral and clearing lanes.
8. **Side-stair flank**: Flank guards eliminated; main stair defense collapsed from above.
9. **Public werebear incident**: Khagar transformed publicly during the Cloud District push; Thalmor divination pressure completes escalation.
10. **Session end position**: Dragonsreach approach secured; Stormcloaks hold Cloud District lanes; Khagar and Ralof regroup at the walkway.

### Mechanical Summary (End of Session)
- Fate Points (end): **3**
- Ralof Loyalty: **80/100** (Major Trust Tick)
- Stormcloak Rebellion Trust: **6/10**
- Thalmor Intelligence Network: **7/8**
- Thalmor — Scent-Scry Escalation: **6/6 (COMPLETE)** → Operative cell dispatched (silver/fire/propaganda)
- New clocks: Galmar's Resentment (2/4), Khagar—Werebear Evolution (1/4), Whiterun Witnesses: Huntress Targeted (1/4), Whiterun Civilians: "He Protected Us" (1/4), Companions Notice: Aela's Bow (1/4), Aela—Hunt-Debt (1/3)

### Narrative Benefits / Consequences
- **Benefit:** Hadvar alive = leverage/intel potential; moral spine strengthens Ralof's leadership.
- **Benefit:** Civilian corridor improves Whiterun perception (counterweight to beast rumors).
- **Consequence:** Galmar internal friction rising; Companions notice Aela's bow; Thalmor counter-hunt machine spins up due to public beast-form anomaly.

### Next Session Start Hook
At the Dragonsreach approach, decide the play:
- **Parley at the doors** (Ralof speaks, Khagar looms),
- **Breach** (physics and fear),
- **Leverage** (Hadvar alive, corridor goodwill, Aela hunt-debt),
while preparing for **Thalmor counter-operations** and internal Stormcloak hardliner backlash.
