**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Act:** 1  
**Scene ID:** A1-S03-WHITERUN-INNER-APPROACHES-HADVAR-DUEL  
**Active Hold:** Whiterun  
**Session Objective:** Permit wounded retreat under oath; duel Hadvar for blood price or withdrawal; keep Stormcloak breach stabilized.

## Opening Recap (What just happened)
- Khagar Yal defeated Legate Rikke's perimeter command knot; forced her concession and escape.
- Rikke carries a Severe Consequence: **Bitten Hand — Sanies Lupinus Exposure (Beast-Blood Seeded)**.
- Stormcloak assault escalated into the Battle of Whiterun proper.
- Khagar led the breach: shattered an Imperial shield wall, executed a conducting officer, and took his heart as a trophy.
- Ralof eliminated the horn wielder, disrupting withdrawal signaling and worsening Imperial cohesion.
- Hadvar attempted to rally the reserve node; Khagar struck him hard enough to force a severe injury and retreat order.
- Khagar pursued but chose honor: offered a healing draught and terms of a duel to allow wounded/civilians to retreat inside the gates.

## Key Mechanical Outcomes
### Consequences / Stress
- **Hadvar:** Severe Consequence — *Cracked Shield Arm (conceded reserve knot to protect wounded)*
- **Ralof:** Physical Stress — box 2 marked (2-shift hit while cutting runner lane)
- **Rikke:** Severe Consequence already recorded; off-board (triage), infected (incubation clock active)

### Scene Aspects Created / Spent
- **Pack Tactics** advantages used to lure and overrun the shield wall.
- **Imperial Counterplan Compromised** (from captured dispatch case) spent to accelerate command collapse.
- **Scent of Blood** used on Hadvar: Aspect *Predator vs Prey* gained (2 free invokes) and *Wild Hunt* mark applied (session tracking bonus).
- **Warchief's Wisdom** used on Hadvar: intent read — protect wounded/civilians over victory.
