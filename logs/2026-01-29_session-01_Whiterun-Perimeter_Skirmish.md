# Session 01 — Whiterun Perimeter Skirmish (Mid-Session Checkpoint)
**Date:** 2026-01-29  
**Act:** I  
**Scene:** A1-S01-WHITERUN-PERIMETER-RIKKE-KNOT  
**Location:** Whiterun Hold — Imperial perimeter camp (outer ring, command-tent knot)

## Objective
Disrupt Imperial command cohesion before the Battle of Whiterun; extract intel; keep the alarm contained.

## Key Beats (Canon)
- Khagar Yal performs a predator's herb-smoke rite to sharpen scent and isolate a "worthy trail" through Imperial lines.
- The trail identifies Legate Rikke's position (command-tent knot).
- Khagar coordinates a pack strike: scouts/alarms removed, breach forced, inner knot disrupted.
- Khagar engages Rikke directly; the fight becomes personal and ideological (predator vs officer; truth vs denial).
- Rikke concedes to escape. She survives and withdraws—BUT pays a cost:
  - Dispatch case captured (Imperial tactical notes).
  - Khagar bites Rikke's hand during the breakaway: Sanies Lupinus exposure seeded.

## Concession Terms (Rules Note)
Rikke's concession prevents capture/kill in this conflict; the victor's gains are the intel + lasting harm (infection seed), consistent with her escape.

## Immediate Next Pressure
Battle of Whiterun clock is already at 8/8—this scene's outcome will matter fast.
