- Aldric cracked the concealed wall safe.
  - Overcome (Stealth): SUCCESS on a tie by leveraging patron access/directions.
  - Consumed 1 free invoke: **Battle-Born Patronage**.
  - Minor complication: **The House Hears Something** (faint tick from the safe mechanism; potential upstairs check if time passes).
- Safe contents spotted:
  - Iron-banded portable strongbox (primary objective)
  - Sealed oilcloth folio (Battle-Born signet)
  - Loose ledger page with payments and a line item marked "E."

## Scene WHT-06 — "Strongbox in the Wind"
- Aldric closed the wall safe cleanly and exited via the prepped upper window route.
- Used stunt: **RUNNING ON AIR** to create "Gale-Runner" during exfil and move rapidly across rooftops.

- Consumed invoke: **Second Exit Prepped** (free invoke used).

  - Create Advantage (Athletics): **Backtracked Mirage** — SUCCESS WITH STYLE (2 free invokes).

  - New Scene Aspect: **Echoing WULD** (GM: 1 free invoke)
  - Mastery tick: Whirlwind Sprint mastery +1
- Result: Pursuers committed to the wrong route; Aldric reappeared on/near Battle-Born roofline with the strongbox still secured.

## Scene WHT-07B — Rooftop Intercept (Guard Scuffle)
- Aldric intentionally provoked a rooftop guard into striking first, baiting an “official” escalation.
- Defense was handled with **Rift Rat Fight-Style** and positioning; Aldric won cleanly and fast.
- **Boost gained:** *Cheap Shot* (from a Success With Style defense), used to control the guard’s tempo and end the exchange without lethal force.
- The guard was left winded/disabled long enough to avoid pursuit; Aldric lifted a **small key ring** and a bit of loose coin during the frisk.

## Scene WHT-08 — The Price of Quiet (Olfrid’s Intel)
- Aldric returned to **Olfrid Battle-Born** and produced the requested strongbox.
- Olfrid paid the remainder and shared critical intel:
  - **Whiterun is headed toward open battle.**
  - An Imperial named **Hadvar** will be present and visible in the defense.
  - To unlock deeper “doors” in Whiterun’s political/Thieves Guild web, Aldric must be **seen fighting alongside Hadvar** (or otherwise formally align with the Empire).
- Olfrid provided a **sealed note (Olfrid → Hadvar)** to be used during the Battle of Whiterun.

## End of Session — Session 1 Wrap
- **Gold:** 645 septims (recorded)
- **Recovery:** Mild consequence *Ragged Voice* cleared (end-of-session recovery)
- **Milestone:** **Minor Milestone**
